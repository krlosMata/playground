/* This circuit will check there is enough balance in the oldStAmount to transfer
   the amount and the fee. newAmount is the amount remaining into the state.
   effectiveAmount is the amount that actually is transfered.

   In an onChain Transaction, no errors are allowed, so in case it is not enough money,
   it will do a 0 transfer.

   In case of an offChain TX the system does not allow it.

   Overflow of < 2^192 is not feasible since deposits amounts can not be above 2^128
